          <h2>What have I been up to?</h2>
          <p>Over the summer I decided to occupy my time during the recent lockdown with teaching myself new skills and so I decided to learn how to code, teaching myself Kotlin and android app design/development, finding a way to channel my crreativity. I'm new to the programming world but it very much excites me, I have been working on a couple of large app design projects which I have loved working on, such as Drinks and Dragons and Happy Hour which can be found in the Programming section.</p>
          <p>Alongside app design and Kotlin I have started the Zero to Mastery course by Andrei Neagoie in which I am learning more programming skills and languages such as HTML, CSS JavaScript in which I used to make this website from scratch!! You can check out the coding section from the </p>
          <p>On the sporty side I am a keen fencer which I have kept up for 7 years now and have achieved many goals and represented my country many times over the years. Find out more in the Here.</p>
