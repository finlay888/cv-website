        			The Astley Ainslie Hospital was a great experience where I spent time shadowing professionals and sitting in with patients whilst observing amazing rehabilitation devices. These included advanced upper and lower limb prosthetics by Ottobock, spinal braces, occipital braces and many other orthapedic devices.<br><br>
        			The Astley Ainslie also has a gait lab in which I got to observe the amazing technology of gait analysis using cameras and sensors which allowed for the patient's orthapedics or prosthetics to be adjusted for optimum gait. This was a perfect example of how amazing biomedical engineering and how it's applications really help people.<br><br>
        			A special rehabilitation clinic was also open to certain patients which unique solutions to patients disabilites were created such as specialised bikes with steering controlled by leaning or wheelchairs controlled with chin movement or other movement. I got to work with the engineers in this department and got participate in the problem solving process of the rehabilitation engineering.

        		<p>
        			At the Royal Infirmary I shadowed a cardiologist and met a Medtronic engineer who taught me about how pacemaker and ICD units operate. I sat in on implantation operations of the devices and got to see how the devices affect the patient and how invasive technologies are not ideal in patients. <br><br>

        			I also learnt about the massive risk associated with the devices and the failures which can occure which really goes to show how far the devices still have to go.
