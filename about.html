    	<h2><u>Welcome!</u></h2>
    	<p>Hello there, my name is Finlay McAndrew and welcome to my personal portfolio website!! Here you can find out a bit about me and see some of the stuff I've been working on.</p>
    	<p>I grew up in Edinburgh and now I am a student studying Biomedical Engineering at the University of Glasgow. I'm in my third year now and I am thriving, my course fills me with passion and the more I learn the more I want to go out there and apply what I have learned</p>
    	<p>Over the summer I decided to occupy my time during the recent lockdown with teaching myself new skills and so I decided to learn how to code, teaching myself Kotlin and android app design/development, finding a way to channel my crreativity. I'm new to the programming world but it very much excites me, I have been working on a couple of large app design projects which I have loved working on, such as Drinks and Dragons and Happy Hour which can be found in the Programming section.</p>
    	<p>Alongside app design and Kotlin I have started the Zero to Mastery course by Andrei Neagoie in which I am learning more programming skills and languages such as HTML, CSS JavaScript in which I used to make this website!!</p>
    	<p>On the sporty side I am a keen fencer which I have kept up for 7 years now and have achieved many goals and represented my country many times over the years. Find out more in the Here.</p>
