    	<h2>What can I do?</h2>
    	<p>On the side, I have been teaching myself to code in languages such as Kotlin for Android app development and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for web development. I really like the potential it gives you to be able to create something new such as new apps and programs and it gives me a way to channel my creativity into creating something unique. At university I've been learning how to use Matlab and Simulink to build simulations for engineering systems.</p>

        <h2>Some stuff I've done</h2>
        <p>Over the summer I completed a Android development and Kotlin masterclass online by Tutorials.eu by Denis Panjuta where I learned about the fundamentals of Kotlin and object-oriented programming and how to create apps. I chose Kotlin over Java because although Java is more widely used, Kotlin is being pushed by Google to be the future language for android development. I have created a number of small apps and a couple of larger projects, I don't have anything on the app store yet as I am still adding to the apps and debugging these processes do take time, however I have provided small sample videos of the apps below.</p>
        <div class="video-container">
        	<div class="program-left video-spacer-left">
        		<video class="program-left" width="270" height="480" controls loop autoplay muted>
        		<source src="./videos/drinks&dragons_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        		Your browser doesn't support the video tag
        		</video>
        	</div>
        	<div class="program-right">
        		<video class="program-right video-spacer-right" width="270" height="480" controls loop autoplay muted>
        		<source src="./videos/happyhour_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser doesn't support the video tag
        		</video>
        	</div>
        </div>
        <p>The above videos show two of my larger projects which are still in the making, Drinks & Dragons and Happy Hour. Drinks & Dragons is a fun drinking game rpg which involves 1-6 players who fight monsters and acquire treasure on their way to gaining 6 status points to become a "total legend", this game was very fun to create and play with my friends. It has been taking extra long because I have drawn all the artwork by hand myself and I am still adding more to the game little by little.</p>
        <p>Happy Hour is a cocktail and drinks app which includes many premade recipes which can be searched by category, name and ingredient, acquired from <a class="embedded-link" href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/" target="_blank">TheCocktailDB</a>. It also includes a create drink function and customisable user profiles. This app uses Firebase Firestore to store images and data online. </p>
        <p>I am also part way through a <a class="embedded-link" href="https://zerotomastery.io/" target="_blank">Zero to Mastery</a> course by Andrei Neagoie which is teaching me front and back end web development. An example of stuff I've created is this website!! I am a way off finishing the course however, so I do not have any big projects to showcase</p>
